# Sending E-Mails

# DIY mail sending

- Use [`nodemailer`](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) through [`@nestjs-modules/mailer`](https://github.com/nest-modules/mailer)
- Easy to configure your SMTP access
- Comes with templating
- Or even better with [`react-email`](https://github.com/resend/react-email)
- SMTP is easy to get at any webhoster, provides enough functionality for most midsize projects

# How to send mails in development

- Wanting to test email delivery to multiple mails
  - Could use e-mail aliases like plus-aliasing and real SMTP: slug+alias@most-big-mail-companies.com
- Customers are often late to deliver their SMTP credentials
- Don't really want so send mails to any real user

# Testing

- Use `cheerio` for HTML parsing

```ts
const mailpit = {
  async latestTo(email: string) {
    return (await fetch(`http://localhost:8025/view/latest.html?query=to:${email}`)).text();
  },
};
```

```ts
it('sends mail on intialization', async () => {
  await agent().post('/password-reset').send({ email: E2E_SEED_EDITOR_EMAIL }).expect(201);

  const mailHtml = await mailpit.latestTo(E2E_SEED_EDITOR_EMAIL);

  expect(mailHtml).toBeDefined();
  const $ = cheerio.load(mailHtml);
  expect($('h1').contents().first().text()).toEqual('Passwort zur√ºcksetzen');
});
```
